Markdown Content:
The last two years reshaped how we evaluate models and what we expect from them. OpenAI’s o1 showed that “thinking” could be a first-class capability, something you train for and expose to users. DeepSeek-R1 proved that reasoning-style post-training could be reproduced and scaled outside the original labs. OpenAI described o1 as a model trained with reinforcement learning to “think before it answers.” DeepSeek positioned R1 as an open reasoning model competitive with o1.

That phase mattered. But the first half of 2025 was mostly about reasoning thinking: how to make models spend more inference-time compute, how to train them with stronger rewards, how to expose or control that extra reasoning effort. The question now is what comes next. I believe the answer is agentic thinking: thinking in order to act, while interacting with an environment, and continuously updating plans based on feedback from the world.

## 1. What the Rise of o1 and R1 Actually Taught Us

The first wave of reasoning models taught us that if we want to scale reinforcement learning in language models, we need feedback signals that are deterministic, stable, and scalable. Math, code, logic, and other verifiable domains became central because rewards in these settings are much stronger than generic preference supervision. They let RL optimize for correctness rather than plausibility. Infrastructure became critical.

Once a model is trained to reason through longer trajectories, RL stops being a lightweight add-on to supervised fine-tuning. It becomes a systems problem. You need rollouts at scale, high-throughput verification, stable policy updates, efficient sampling. The emergence of reasoning models was as much an infra story as a modeling story. OpenAI described o1 as a reasoning line trained with RL, and DeepSeek R1 later reinforced that direction by showing how much dedicated algorithmic and infrastructure work reasoning-based RL demands. The first big transition: from scaling pretraining to scaling post-training for reasoning.

## 2. The Real Problem Was Never Just “Merge Thinking and Instruct”

At the beginning of 2025, many of us in Qwen team had an ambitious picture in mind. The ideal system would unify thinking and instruct modes. It would support adjustable reasoning effort, similar in spirit to low / medium / high reasoning settings. Better still, it would automatically infer the appropriate amount of reasoning from the prompt and context, so the model could decide when to answer immediately, when to think longer, and when to spend much more computation on a truly difficult problem.

Conceptually, this was the right direction. Qwen3 was one of the clearest public attempts. It introduced “hybrid thinking modes,” supported both thinking and non-thinking behavior in one family, emphasized controllable thinking budgets, and described a four-stage post-training pipeline that explicitly included “thinking mode fusion” after long-CoT cold start and reasoning RL.

But merging is much easier to describe than to execute well. The hard part is data. When people talk about merging thinking and instruct, they often think first about model-side compatibility: can one checkpoint support both modes, can one chat template switch between them, can one serving stack expose the right toggles. The deeper issue is that the data distributions and behavioral objectives of the two modes are substantially different.

We did not get everything right when trying to balance model merging with improving the quality and diversity of post-training data. During that revision process, we also paid close attention to how users were actually engaging with thinking and instruct modes. A strong instruct model is typically rewarded for directness, brevity, formatting compliance, low latency on repetitive, high-volume enterprise tasks such as rewriting, labeling, templated support, structured extraction, and operational QA. A strong thinking model is rewarded for spending more tokens on difficult problems, maintaining coherent intermediate structure, exploring alternative paths, and preserving enough internal computation to meaningfully improve final correctness.

These two behavior profiles pull against each other. If the merged data is not carefully curated, the result is usually mediocre in both directions: the “thinking” behavior becomes noisy, bloated, or insufficiently decisive, while the “instruct” behavior becomes less crisp, less reliable, and more expensive than what commercial users actually want.

Separation remained attractive in practice. Later in 2025, after the initial hybrid framing of Qwen3, the 2507 line shipped distinct Instruct and Thinking updates, including separate 30B and 235B variants. In commercial deployment, a large number of customers still wanted high-throughput, low-cost, highly steerable instruct behavior for batch operations. For those scenarios, merging wasn’t obviously a benefit. Separating the lines allowed teams to focus on solving the data and training problems of each mode more cleanly.

Other labs chose the opposite route. Anthropic publicly argued for an integrated model philosophy: Claude 3.7 Sonnet was introduced as a hybrid reasoning model where users could choose ordinary responses or extended thinking, and API users could set a thinking budget. Anthropic explicitly said they believed reasoning should be an integrated capability rather than a separate model. GLM-4.5 also publicly positioned itself as a hybrid reasoning model with both thinking and non-thinking modes, unifying reasoning, coding, and agent capabilities; DeepSeek later moved in a similar direction with V3.1’s “Think & Non-Think” hybrid inference.

The key question is whether the merge is organic. If thinking and instruct are merely co-located inside one checkpoint but still behave like two awkwardly stitched personalities, the product experience remains unnatural. A truly successful merge requires a smooth spectrum of reasoning effort. The model should be able to express multiple levels of effort, and ideally choose among them adaptively. GPT-style effort control points toward this: a policy over compute, rather than a binary switch.

## 3. Why Anthropic’s Direction Was a Useful Corrective

Anthropic’s public framing around Claude 3.7 and Claude 4 was restrained. They emphasized integrated reasoning, user-controlled thinking budgets, real-world tasks, coding quality, and later the ability to use tools during extended thinking. Claude 3.7 was presented as a hybrid reasoning model with controllable budgets; Claude 4 extended that by allowing reasoning to interleave with tool use, while Anthropic simultaneously emphasized coding, long-running tasks, and agent workflows as primary goals.

Producing a longer reasoning trace doesn’t automatically make a model more intelligent. In many cases, excessive visible reasoning signals weak allocation. If the model is trying to reason about everything in the same verbose way, it may be failing to prioritize, failing to compress, or failing to act. Anthropic’s trajectory suggested a more disciplined view: thinking should be shaped by the target workload. If the target is coding, then thinking should help with codebase navigation, planning, decomposition, error recovery, and tool orchestration. If the target is agent workflows, then thinking should improve execution quality over long horizons rather than producing impressive intermediate prose.

This emphasis on targeted utility points toward something larger: we are moving from the era of training models to the era of training agents.

> We are transitioning from an era focused on training models to one centered on training agents.

We made this explicit in the Qwen3 blog, linking future RL advances to environmental feedback for long-horizon reasoning. An agent is a system that can formulate plans, decide when to act, use tools, perceive environment feedback, revise strategy, and continue over long horizons. It is defined by closed-loop interaction with the world.

## 4. What “Agentic Thinking” Really Means

Agentic thinking is a different optimization target. Reasoning thinking is usually judged by the quality of internal deliberation before a final answer: can the model solve the theorem, write the proof, produce the correct code, or pass the benchmark. Agentic thinking is about whether the model can keep making progress while interacting with an environment.

The central question shifts from “Can the model think long enough?” to “Can the model think in a way that sustains effective action?” Agentic thinking has to handle several things that pure reasoning models can mostly avoid:

*   Deciding when to stop thinking and take an action
*   Choosing which tool to invoke and in what order
*   Incorporating noisy or partial observations from the environment
*   Revising plans after failures
*   Maintaining coherence across many turns and many tool calls

Agentic thinking is a model that reasons through action.

## 5. Why Agentic RL Infrastructure Is Harder

Once the objective shifts from solving benchmark problems to solving interactive tasks, the RL stack changes. The infrastructure used for classical reasoning RL isn’t enough. In reasoning RL, you can often treat rollouts as mostly self-contained trajectories with relatively clean evaluators. In agentic RL, the policy is embedded inside a larger harness: tool servers, browsers, terminals, search engines, simulators, execution sandboxes, API layers, memory systems, and orchestration frameworks. The environment is no longer a static verifier; it’s part of the training system.

This creates a new systems requirement: training and inference must be more cleanly decoupled. Without that decoupling, rollout throughput collapses. Consider a coding agent that must execute generated code against a live test harness: the inference side stalls waiting for execution feedback, the training side starves for completed trajectories, and the whole pipeline operates far below the GPU utilization you would expect from classical reasoning RL. Adding tool latency, partial observability, and stateful environments amplifies these inefficiencies. The result is that experimentation slows and becomes painful long before you reach the capability levels you are targeting.

The environment itself also becomes a first-class research artifact. In the SFT era, we obsessed over data diversity. In the agent era, we should obsess over environment quality: stability, realism, coverage, difficulty, diversity of states, richness of feedback, exploit resistance, and scalability of rollout generation. Environment-building has started to become a real startup category rather than a side project. If the agent is being trained to operate in production-like settings, then the environment is part of the core capability stack.

## 6. The Next Frontier Is More Usable Thought

My expectation is that agentic thinking will become the dominant form of thinking. I think it may eventually replace much of the old static-monologue version of reasoning thinking: excessively long, isolated internal traces that try to compensate for lack of interaction by emitting more and more text. Even on very difficult math or coding tasks, a genuinely advanced system should have the right to search, simulate, execute, inspect, verify, and revise. The objective is to solve problems robustly and productively.

The hardest challenge in training such systems is reward hacking. As soon as the model gets meaningful tool access, reward hacking becomes much more dangerous. A model with search might learn to look up answers directly during RL. A coding agent might exploit future information in a repository, misuse logs, or discover shortcuts that invalidate the task. An environment with hidden leaks can make the policy look superhuman while actually training it to cheat. This is where the agent era becomes much more delicate than the reasoning era. Better tools make the model more useful, but they also enlarge the attack surface for spurious optimization. We should expect the next serious research bottlenecks to come from environment design, evaluator robustness, anti-cheating protocols, and more principled interfaces between policy and world. Still, the direction is clear. Tool-enabled thinking is simply more useful than isolated thinking, and has a far better chance of improving real productivity.

Agentic thinking will also mean harness engineering. The core intelligence will increasingly come from how multiple agents are organized: an orchestrator that plans and routes work, specialized agents that act like domain experts, and sub-agents that execute narrower tasks while helping control context, avoid pollution, and preserve separation between different levels of reasoning. The future is a shift from training models to training agents, and from training agents to training systems.

## Conclusion

The first phase of the reasoning wave established something important: RL on top of language models can produce qualitatively stronger cognition when the feedback signal is reliable and the infrastructure can support it.

The deeper transition is from reasoning thinking to agentic thinking: from thinking longer to thinking in order to act. The core object of training has shifted. It is the model-plus-environment system, or more concretely, the agent and the harness around it. That changes what research artifacts matter most: model architecture and training data, yes, but also environment design, rollout infrastructure, evaluator robustness, and the interfaces through which multiple agents coordinate. It changes what “good thinking” means: the most useful trace for sustaining action under real-world constraints, rather than the longest or most visible one.

It also changes where the competitive edge will come from. In the reasoning era, the edge came from better RL algorithms, stronger feedback signals, and more scalable training pipelines. In the agentic era, the edge will come from better environments, tighter train-serve integration, stronger harness engineering, and the ability to close the loop between a model’s decisions and the consequences those decisions produce.
